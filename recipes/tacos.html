                    teaspoons chili powder, or to taste;

                <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>½ cup tomato sauce</li>
                <li>½ cup water</li>
                <li>8 taco-size corn or flour tortillas</li>
                    Toppings, as desired: shredded cheese, 
                    shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, 
                    sour cream, avocado, guacamole, cilantro, 
                    chopped red onion, etc.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                    Add the beef to the skillet and cook, 
                    crumbling with a spoon or spatula, until 
                    browned. Drain any excess grease from the 
                    skillet. (If you used 90% or 93% lean ground 
                    beef there may not be any extra grease to 
                    drain.)</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the chili 
                    powder, cumin, garlic powder, dried oregano, 
                    onion powder, salt, pepper, tomato sauce and 
                    water to the skillet. Stir to combine and cook, 
                    stirring often, for 5 minutes, until taco meat 
                    is fully cooked and has reached your desired 
                    texture.</li>
                <li>Serve the taco meat in warmed tortillas, with 
                    toppings as desired.</li>
