            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>

                <li>3/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>3 pounds cube steak (tenderized round 
                    steak that's been extra tenderized)</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup canola or vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Gravy</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 to 4 cups whole milk</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Mashed potatoes, for serving</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Directions</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>For the steak: Begin with setting up an 
                    assembly line of dishes. Mix the milk with 
                    the eggs in one; the flour mixed with the 
                    seasoned salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper, 
                    paprika and cayenne in another; and the meat 
                    in a third. Then have one clean plate at the 
                    end to receive the breaded meat.</li>
                <li>Work with one piece of meat at a time. 
                    Sprinkle both sides with kosher salt and black 
                    pepper, then place it in the flour mixture. 
                    Turn to coat. Place the meat into the milk/egg 
                    mixture, turning to coat. Finally, place it back 
                    in the flour and turn to coat (dry mixture/wet 
                    mixture/dry mixture). Place the breaded meat on 
                    the clean plate, then repeat with the remaining 
                    meat.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                    Add the butter. Drop in a few sprinkles of flour to 
                    make sure it's sufficiently hot. When the butter 
                    sizzles immediately, you know it's ready. (It should 
                    not brown right away, if it does, the fire is too hot.)
                    Cook the meat, 3 pieces at a time, until the edges start 
                    to look golden brown, about 2 minutes each side. Remove 
                    the meat to a paper towel-lined plate and keep them warm 
                    by covering lightly with another plate or a sheet of foil.
                    Repeat until all the meat is cooked.</li>
                <li>After all the meat is fried, pour off the grease into a 
                    heatproof bowl. Without cleaning the skillet, return it to 
                    the stove over medium-low heat. Add 1/4 cup of the grease 
                    back to the skillet and allow it to heat up.</li>
                <li>For the gravy: When the grease is hot, sprinkle the flour 
                    evenly over the grease. Using a whisk, mix the flour with 
                    the grease, creating a golden-brown paste. Add more flour 
                    if it looks overly greasy; add a little more grease if it 
                    becomes too pasty/clumpy. Keep cooking until the roux 
                    reaches a deep golden brown color.</li>
                <li>Pour in the milk, whisking constantly. Add the seasoned 
                    salt and black pepper to taste and cook, whisking, until 
                    the gravy is smooth and thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Be prepared 
                    to add more milk if it becomes overly thick. Be sure to 
                    taste to make sure gravy is sufficiently seasoned.</li>
                <li>Serve the meat next to a big side of mashed potatoes. 
                    Pour gravy over the whole shebang!</li>
            </ol>
